	//for updating data in database we have custom query methods
	
	//in this interface we just declare method and it's implementation is given by spring in a proxy class
	//spring gives implementation according to our requirement
	//for spring to give its implementation, we have to follow a naming format for the custom finder methods
	//findBy-{properyName}-{keyword}
	//for keyword and other details, refer to - https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/jpa/query-methods.html

	List<Bike> findByBrandInAndPriceBetween(List<String> brands, Double minP, Double maxP);
	//we uses 'AND' keyword to implement 2 conditions
	//'IN' keyword is like when we say 'WHERE BRAND IN ()' something like this in SQL
	
	
	//NOTICE - here we are only filtering row, and we are fetching all column details for those records
	//			we can also choose which columns we want to fetch
	// 			there comes in the concept of static and dynamic projection -> see next project
